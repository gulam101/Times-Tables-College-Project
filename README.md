# Times-Tables-College-Project

College project

Goal: The goal of the project was to create something that would teach an age group so that they may learn something new. The project scenario was set in a way so that the client had to develop an application for a school that would help them learn how to use the application.

Instructions: User can click on the times table from 1 - 12 and it will show them first 10 multiplications within that table. 

What I learnt: During the design of this application I learnt how to make the interface look neater. I also had a further understanding on how the GUI works on Windows Standard Form. I also enhanced my knowledge on C# and started to get familiar with loops and if statements. I also figured out how to get the tool box back when it disappeared from the menu

Constraints: When I created this project I had an issue understanding how LOOPS worked but I solved this problem by researching and understanding how it worked. I also had the issue of the tool box but that was bug within the VS Studio.

Improvements:
