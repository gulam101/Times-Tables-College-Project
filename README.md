# Times-Tables-College-Project

### Goal:

The goal of the project was to create something that would teach an age group so that they may learn something new. The project scenario was set in a way so that the client had to develop an application for a school that would help them learn how to use the application.

### Instructions:

User can click on the times table from 1 - 12 and it will show them first 10 multiplications within that table.

### What I learnt: 
- Improved knowledge on GUI in Windows Standard Form
- How to use toolbox
- Improving knowledge on LOOPS
- Improved knowledge on IF statements
- Keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio 2017
- How to place text on screen

### Constraints:

When I created this project I had an issue understanding how LOOPS worked but I solved this problem by researching and understanding how it worked. I also had the issue of the tool box but that was bug within the VS Studio.

### Improvements:
I think the interface could be increased because showing the tables themselves seem like they are cramped.
