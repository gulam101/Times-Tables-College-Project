### Description:
For this project scenario I had to design an application that would help students with their times table. For the scenario, the project needed to have an interface that would be easy to use and it challenges the user to create something simple opposed to something that looks difficult. The project had to be completed within the 25 minute deadline and presented in front of the group.

The point of this project was to learn about C# and get a stronger understanding about how interfaces work. For the design of the project I had to use Windows Standard Form and get a better understanding of how to use the toolbox.

### Instructions:

User can click on the times table from 1 - 12 and it will show them first 10 multiplications within that table.

### Planned Features:

I think for this project I would change the interface so that it is large enough to fit all the data on the screen. But I don't think I want to change too much for this project because I don't want to remove any of the original code I did for this project back in college.

### What I learnt: 
- Improved knowledge on GUI in Windows Standard Form
- How to use toolbox
- Improved knowledge on LOOPS
- Improved knowledge on IF statements
- Keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio 2017
- How to place text on screen

### Constraints:

When I created this project I had an issue understanding how LOOPS worked but I solved this problem by researching and understanding how it worked. I also had the issue of the tool box dissapearing after opening and closing visual studio. The fix was to use the command CTRL + x and this would rebuild the toolbar.


### Improvements:
I think the interface could be increased because showing the tables looks like they are almost going off the screen.
